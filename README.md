 <div align='center'><h1>Staff Allocation</h1></div>

## Problem Statement

Uneven task distribution among staff members is impacting productivity and job satisfaction. The need for an automated system arises to minimize successively assigned tasks for each staff member. The goal is to optimize workforce efficiency while maintaining a fair and equitable task allocation process.

### Constraints

1. Staff members have varying workload capacities
2. Equitable task distribution as Workload Balancing
3. Each job may have varying requirement

Example: Teacher Allocation in Examination Rooms
